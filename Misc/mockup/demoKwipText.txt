Demo kwip - let this come at once the user signups
*************
hey this is a demo kwip. you could integrate your Gtalk and Yahoo messenger status, share links, write a poem, meet old friends and meet new ones; and 100 other things you can think of.

i have got this other idea...
the user sees this above thing

let the others - the ones who are following him (right now one of us and later on whoever have invited him)
and on the everyone timeline --see another one namely this - 
two reasons for this.. 
1.one no point in the users already there who have invited or...on the everyone page to see the demo kwip again and again
2.to make them go and start talking.
