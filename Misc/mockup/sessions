sessions

1. remember password - 
	a) within the site - checkbox
	b) browser specific

	#in firefox there is this saved passwords list. 1a) doesnt show a saved password
	#the browser popup which says remember - shows in the password list 

2. session expire - 
 	a)on logout
	b)browser close (in firefox its clear not sure abt IE)
	c)dont do anything for 1b)
	
frankly since ours is not a financial/risky operation .sessions are not very crucial. we only need to see who are the recent logins, hence have to expire sessions.
