1. the three mockups show the 3 possible steps. 

clicking invite non users --> opens textbox
clicking invite more --> opens another textbox
add button converts the email id to text with remove as link next to it.


2. when finally the user invites, 
the email ids get an invite with a link - when they click that link they see the comment box open. I'll add a textbox where they can put there name. i think we should make it compulsory for users to give a name. then others can refer to him when needed.
the link should be usable multiple times. (we might have to do a ban this email id from a thread in future :)

3. in the backend ..store the display name the user has put. next time the same email id gets an invite fill that name inside the textbox by default (but do keep it editable). also keep all the comments which are associated with one email id.
